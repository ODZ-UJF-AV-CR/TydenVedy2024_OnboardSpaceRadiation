## Project Overview

How is cosmic radiation detected on aircraft? What is the relationship between radiation intensity, altitude, and geographical location? How is the radiation exposure of aircraft crews evaluated? During this mini-project, we will attempt to answer these questions and more. If weather conditions permit, the project will include a measurement flight with a radiation detector reaching an altitude of 4000 meters.

### Instrumentation

This measurement flight was conducted on June 16, 2024, from the [Příbram Airport](https://www.letiste-pribram.cz/) Dlouhá lhota, near to Příbram city. Several instruments were onboard to measure cosmic radiation:

- 2x [AIRDOS04](https://docs.dos.ust.cz/airdos/AIRDOS04/manual)
- 3x [LABDOS01](https://docs.dos.ust.cz/labdos/LABDOS01)
- 2x RT Particle Detector
- 1x (another detector)
- 1x Barometer with GPS

### Objectives

- To understand the detection methods of cosmic radiation on aircraft.
- To analyze the variation of radiation intensity with altitude and geographical location.
- To assess the radiation exposure of aircraft crews using collected data.
